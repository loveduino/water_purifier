@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that build the application to be
loaded into Flash memory using In-Application Programming (IAP, through USART).

To build such application, some special configuration has to be performed:
1. Set the application load address at 0x08003000, using your toolchain linker file
2. To be able to serve the application interrupts, you need to relocate the vector 
   table (which contains the interrupt handlers). However, unlike CortexM3 and CortexM4, 
   the CortexM0 processor do not support vector table relocation (it is fixed at 
   address 0x00000000).
   A solution will be to relocate by software the vector table to the internal SRAM:  
    - Copy the vector table from the Flash (mapped at the base of the application load
      address 0x08003000) to the base address of the SRAM at 0x20000000.
    - Remap SRAM at address 0x00000000, using SYSCFG_MemoryRemapConfig() function
    - Then once an interrupt occurs, the CortexM0 processor will fetch the interrupt 
      handler start address from the relocated vector table in SRAM, then it will 
      jump to execute the interrupt handler located in the Flash.
   This operation should be done at the initialization phase of the application.    
   
The SysTick example provided within the STM32F0xx Standard Peripherals library 
examples is used as illustration.
This example configures the SysTick to generate a time base equal to 1 ms.
The system clock is set to the maximum system frequency, the SysTick is clocked by 
the AHB clock (HCLK). A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick 
end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that build the application to be
loaded into Flash memory using In-Application Programming (IAP, through USART).

To build such application, some special configuration has to be performed:
1. Set the application load address at 0x08003000, using your toolchain linker file
2. To be able to serve the application interrupts, you need to relocate the vector 
   table (which contains the interrupt handlers). However, unlike CortexM3 and CortexM4, 
   the CortexM0 processor do not support vector table relocation (it is fixed at 
   address 0x00000000).
   A solution will be to relocate by software the vector table to the internal SRAM:  
    - Copy the vector table from the Flash (mapped at the base of the application load
      address 0x08003000) to the base address of the SRAM at 0x20000000.
    - Remap SRAM at address 0x00000000, using SYSCFG_MemoryRemapConfig() function
    - Then once an interrupt occurs, the CortexM0 processor will fetch the interrupt 
      handler start address from the relocated vector table in SRAM, then it will 
      jump to execute the interrupt handler located in the Flash.
   This operation should be done at the initialization phase of the application.    
   
The SysTick example provided within the STM32F0xx Standard Peripherals library 
examples is used as illustration.
This example configures the SysTick to generate a time base equal to 1 ms.
The system clock is set to the maximum system frequency, the SysTick is clocked by 
the AHB clock (HCLK). A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick 
end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that build the application to be
loaded into Flash memory using In-Application Programming (IAP, through USART).

To build such application, some special configuration has to be performed:
1. Set the application load address at 0x08003000, using your toolchain linker file
2. To be able to serve the application interrupts, you need to relocate the vector 
   table (which contains the interrupt handlers). However, unlike CortexM3 and CortexM4, 
   the CortexM0 processor do not support vector table relocation (it is fixed at 
   address 0x00000000).
   A solution will be to relocate by software the vector table to the internal SRAM:  
    - Copy the vector table from the Flash (mapped at the base of the application load
      address 0x08003000) to the base address of the SRAM at 0x20000000.
    - Remap SRAM at address 0x00000000, using SYSCFG_MemoryRemapConfig() function
    - Then once an interrupt occurs, the CortexM0 processor will fetch the interrupt 
      handler start address from the relocated vector table in SRAM, then it will 
      jump to execute the interrupt handler located in the Flash.
   This operation should be done at the initialization phase of the application.    
   
The SysTick example provided within the STM32F0xx Standard Peripherals library 
examples is used as illustration.
This example configures the SysTick to generate a time base equal to 1 ms.
The system clock is set to the maximum system frequency, the SysTick is clocked by 
the AHB clock (HCLK). A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick 
end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that build the application to be
loaded into Flash memory using In-Application Programming (IAP, through USART).

To build such application, some special configuration has to be performed:
1. Set the application load address at 0x08003000, using your toolchain linker file
2. To be able to serve the application interrupts, you need to relocate the vector 
   table (which contains the interrupt handlers). However, unlike CortexM3 and CortexM4, 
   the CortexM0 processor do not support vector table relocation (it is fixed at 
   address 0x00000000).
   A solution will be to relocate by software the vector table to the internal SRAM:  
    - Copy the vector table from the Flash (mapped at the base of the application load
      address 0x08003000) to the base address of the SRAM at 0x20000000.
    - Remap SRAM at address 0x00000000, using SYSCFG_MemoryRemapConfig() function
    - Then once an interrupt occurs, the CortexM0 processor will fetch the interrupt 
      handler start address from the relocated vector table in SRAM, then it will 
      jump to execute the interrupt handler located in the Flash.
   This operation should be done at the initialization phase of the application.    
   
The SysTick example provided within the STM32F0xx Standard Peripherals library 
examples is used as illustration.
This example configures the SysTick to generate a time base equal to 1 ms.
The system clock is set to the maximum system frequency, the SysTick is clocked by 
the AHB clock (HCLK). A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick 
end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

    - Then once an interrupt occurs, the CortexM0 processor will fetch the interrupt 
      handler start address from the relocated vector table in SRAM, then it will 
      jump to execute the interrupt handler located in the Flash.
   This operation should be done at the initialization phase of the application.    
   
The SysTick example provided within the STM32F0xx Standard Peripherals library 
examples is used as illustration.
This example configures the SysTick to generate a time base equal to 1 ms.
The system clock is set to the maximum system frequency, the SysTick is clocked by 
the AHB clock (HCLK). A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick 
end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.
